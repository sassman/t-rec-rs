USAGE:
    t-rec [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] [shell or program to launch]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -l, --ls-win     If you want to see a list of windows available for recording by their id, you can set env var
                     'WINDOWID' to record this specific window only.
    -n, --natural    If you want a very natural typing experience and disable the idle detection and sampling
                     optimization.
    -V, --version    Prints version information
    -v, --verbose    Enable verbose insights for the curious.

OPTIONS:
    -b, --bg <bg>          Background color when decors are used [default: white]  [possible values: white, black,
                           transparent]
    -d, --decor <decor>    Decorates the animation with certain, mostly border effects. [default: shadow]  [possible
                           values: shadow, none]

ARGS:
    <shell or program to launch>    If you want to start a different program than $SHELL you can pass it here. For
                                    example '/bin/sh'
```

### Disable idle detection & optimization

If you are not happy with the idle detection and optimization, you can disable it with the `-n` or `--natural` parameter.
By doing so, you would get the very natural timeline of typing and recording as you do it. 
In this case there will be no optimizations performed.

### Disable shadow border decor

In order to disable the drop shadow border decor you have to pass `-p none` as an argument. If your only want to change 
the color of the background you can use `-b black` for example to have a black background.

## Hidden Gems

You can record not only the terminal but also every other window. There 2 ways to do so:

1) abuse the env var `TERM_PROGRAM` like this:
- for example lets record a window 'Google Chrome'
- make sure chrome is running and visible on screen

```sh
TERM_PROGRAM="google chrome" t-rec

Frame cache dir: "/var/folders/m8/084p1v0x4770rpwpkrgl5b6h0000gn/T/trec-74728.rUxBx3ohGiQ2"
Recording window: "Google Chrome 2"
Press Ctrl+D to end recording

```

this is how it looks then:
![demo-chrome](./docs/demo-chrome.gif)

2) use the env var `WINDOWID` like this:
- for example let's record a `VSCode` window
- figure out the window id program, and make it 
- make sure the window is visible on screen
- set the variable and run `t-rec`

```sh
t-rec --ls-win | grep -i code
Code | 27600

# set the WINDOWID variable and run t-rec
WINDOWID=27600 t-rec

Frame cache dir: "/var/folders/m8/084p1v0x4770rpwpkrgl5b6h0000gn/T/trec-77862.BMYiHNRWqv9Y"
Press Ctrl+D to end recording

```

this is how it looks then:
